This project was created as part of the M3 MedAI Senior Developer technical challenge.
It’s a local-only monorepo using pnpm workspaces, containing:

/apps/reviewer → React + TypeScript app that captures speech or text and sends normalized items to the backend.

/apps/participant → React + TypeScript app that receives and speaks generated clarifying questions in real time.

/services/server → Fastify + Socket.IO backend that calls OpenAI Chat Completions to turn the reviewer’s list into concise, polite follow-up questions.

The apps communicate over WebSockets with strict TypeScript contracts shared via /packages/shared.

Stack: React + TypeScript · Fastify · Socket.IO · OpenAI · pnpm · Vite
